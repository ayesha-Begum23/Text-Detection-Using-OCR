# Text-Detection-Using-OCR
This project utilizes Streamlit, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR to detect and extract text from images and live webcam feeds. It processes uploaded images or captures frames in real time, highlighting detected text with bounding boxes. The application is user-friendly and deployable on Streamlit Cloud or local environments.
